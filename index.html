Like the types of music, the different kinds of instuments, music theory and many more. Were here to teach you about music but first let's give you an introduction about what is music. Music is a form of art. It's also a form of entertainment that puts sound together in a way that people like. Music includes people singing with their voice or playing musical instruments like the piano, violin or saxophone.</p>
    
    <p> Music is a collection of coordinated sound or sounds. Making music is the process of putting sounds and tones in an order, often combining them to create a unified composition. People who make music cratively organize sounds for a desired result, like a Beethoven symphony or one of Duke Ellington's jazz songs. Music is made of sounds, vibrations and silent moments.</p>
